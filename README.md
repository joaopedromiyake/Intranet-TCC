Resources

For all intranet development we use Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, both for front-end and back-end development, and we also use PHP for back-end development, as it is an intranet network and it is necessarily private to us we use MariaDB an OpenSource version of MySQL to create a database with some records to merely test its functionality, we use XAMPP and to upload it to a server and have access to the intranet.
